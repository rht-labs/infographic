# Red Hat Open Innovation Labs Infographic

## Prerequisistes
* NodeJS
* npm

## Running Locally
Run:
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This will start up a local http server to host the fron using the `website` directory as the root context of the front end application. This local development server will also host the API.

## Running in OpenShift

In OpenShift, the front end and back end are hosted as separate applications, using the templates in the `templates` directory.

## Important paths

- `/index.html`: The public-facing infographic page. Clicking the "build" button takes the user to the Open Innovation Labs website.
- `/internal.html`: The "internal" version of infographic. Clicking the "build" button kicks off an Ansible Tower job.
- `/stack`: The node.js API that the front end hits when the user clicks the "build" button. This API passes the request on to Ansible Tower.
